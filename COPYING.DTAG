Although the code for this MagentaCLOUD web application customisation for Nextcloud is free and available under the AGPL3 
license, Deutsche Telekom (including T-Systems) fully reserves all rights to the Telekom brand. To prevent users
from getting confused about the source of a digital product or experience, there are stringent restrictions on using
the Telekom brand and design, even when built into code that we provide. For any customization other than explicitly
for Telekom or T-Systems, you must replace the Deutsche Telekom and T-Systems brand elements contained in the provided
default theme.

Note that especiallay in this theme, the graphical elements, fonts and even the color scheme are intended to implement the
Telekom brand design, so most files have ralationship to brand and need careful check before reuse in own code.
